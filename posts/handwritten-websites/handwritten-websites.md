An HTTP server on an iPhone! With a GUI! The app is free, but it has a paid tier for secure context and
auto refresh. It can run in the background (if the iPhone is charging) and produces a meowing sound every couple of
seconds so that the user won’t unintentionally leave it running.

I thought it could be fun to try to use it with Shortcuts and find a way to make it run a literally handwritten website. Or to try
to write SVG by hand. [Here's the link to the Shortcut if anyone's interested](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f4e15c60abf84befb245a5ff67533114). OCR isn’t perfect, especially for non-letter characters, so I added some regexes for text
replacement. I don’t think I’ll ever be using guillemets in my handwritten websites. I’m also not sure what kind of handwriting the OCR
favours. I tried my best to replicate the handwriting of [world’s best homework
influencers](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/9/15260026/tumblr-study-blogging-studyblr-organization-interview). I found
myself trying to see my handwriting not as a human, but as a computer, imagining what features of a letter would improve
its legibility. Manual fixes were needed most of the time, but I was happy with one proof of concept that
didn’t need much help.

I was also happy to see that marquee isn’t yet gone.

The autogenerated HTML isn't ideal. There's a random `<br />` and the whole thing got wrapped in a `<p>`.
And I guess in the context of usability, there’s little usability. I can imagine a set of fridge magnets with HTML5 semantic
tags that you can later photograph and turn into a website. Or maybe if someone wanted to teach their toddler the
fundamentals of web development for whatever reason then this could be a start. Realistically, if I were to post
something handwritten, I would rather convert it to Markdown (instead of HTML) and let my elaborate Eleventy
configuration handle the rest. But I guess it’s fun to know that this is possible.
