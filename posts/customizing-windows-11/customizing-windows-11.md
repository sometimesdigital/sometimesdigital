#### Remove Garbage: [Sophia Script for Windows](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows)

 - Keep in mind that if you're not careful when selecting the settings, not only will it remove the preinstalled TikTok app but also the default photo viewer.

#### Fix Explorer and Right Click Menus: [Explorer Patcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)
 - Disable Windows 11 context menu
 - Disable "Recommended" in Start menu
 - Disable Office hotkeys

#### Better Search: [Voidtools Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) & [Everything Toolbar](https://github.com/stnkl/EverythingToolbar)

 - Replace Windows Search (which is still available from the Start Menu) with a more robust tool.

#### PowerToys: [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

 - Map `Ctrl + Shift + T` to an OCR tool and copy any text to clipboard
 - Map `Ctrl + Shift + C` to a color picker tool and copy the color HEX code to clipboard
 - Power Rename - rename multiple files at once
 - Image Resizer - resize multiple images at once
 - File Explorer add-ons (better thumbnails etc.)
 - PowerToys Awake - prevent the computer from going to sleep

#### Tray Weather without ads: [Tray Weather](https://github.com/FelixdelasPozas/TrayWeather)

#### Text Expander: [Espanso](https://espanso.org)
 - [Emojis](https://hub.espanso.org/all-emojis)
 - [Arrows](https://hub.espanso.org/arrows)
 - [Math Symbols](https://hub.espanso.org/math-symbols)
 - [Superscripts and subscripts](https://hub.espanso.org/supersubscript)
 - [Lorem Ipsum](https://hub.espanso.org/lorem)

#### Advanced Clipboard Manager: [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/)
 - Browse clipboard history
 - Scripting (it's possible to make the clipboard behave as an LIFO or FIFO stack, for example)

#### [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4)
 - Gets the [predictive IntelliSense](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/shell/using-predictors?view=powershell-7.4) by default. Apparently it is possible to use it with PowerShell 5.1, but I didn't know that before updating.
 - Runs side-by-side with PowerShell 5.1
 - May be configured to get automatic updates with Windows Update

#### Customize PowerShell prompt: [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
 - I like the [uew](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#uew) theme. I have it customized a bit.
