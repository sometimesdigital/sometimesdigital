Wednesday and Friday were off this week because of holidays, and I took Thursday off as well. I saw an old church and went to a castle. The castle was really interesting. It has been renovated pretty consistently for hundreds of years, and you can sort of see how new ideas influenced the renovations over this time.

I set up the page to use the new domain and moved it to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/). For now, this means that I have to use my laptop to add posts because I have to build the page locally and then push the build (instead of using CI/CD). I do also push to GitHub, so the Cloudflare project and the old RSS feed still get updated. I might use Codeberg for more precious projects and GitHub for the hot trash. I also use a local Forgejo instance for self-hosted projects that are just for me and my partner.

We've spent some time on that over the long weekend too. We're replacing the Raspberry Pi with a small HP computer. The idea is that it should take around the same amount of power, but be a little cheaper and more maintainable. So far it's working well! I might make a post about it.

One of the apps we have running on it is a page I made that scrapes the schedules of film screenings in all the cinemas in the city. We actually use it quite a bit. I added caching and fixed the layout a little bit.

I saw *"The Fall Guy"* on Thursday. It was fun but I guess I take movies a little too seriously and I was actually sad afterwards. The main character did get hurt quite a lot on several occasions. But there was a happy ending so I guess it's okay.
