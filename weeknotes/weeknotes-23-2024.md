This week at work I have been fighting with next.js. The project is in the early stages so there’s a lot of setting up to do. The good thing is that I can learn this framework in a *safe space*, in a *supportive team*. But still the experience so far has been very frustrating. Everything is so unintuitive. I used to think that I know how to insert an image or how to make a fetch request… but [not](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) [anymore](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch). It’s also a bit awkward to say that a task like that is taking a lot of time because for a person who doesn’t know the context it seems like an easy thing. The learning curve is very rocky. Hopefully in a couple of weeks I will learn more and cringe at this post. I may be also missing something obvious, like maybe my tooling isn’t configured correctly. I’ve read a post in which someone was very frustrated with TypeScript but it turned out that they didn’t have eslint configured, which I guess is a must with TypeScript.

I went to the dentist and asked her about my jaw pain. She recommended botox for the temporomandibular joint dysfunction. I guess this is what JavaScript does to a person...
