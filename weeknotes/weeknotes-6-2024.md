In the first days of this past week I met my coworkers in real life for the first time. I hope they’re not reading this but it was really nice to see their faces. I was extremely nervous before and even though I quickly became comfortable my stomach kept hurting and I didn’t take part in all of the activities. But still the time at the office was really nice.

Sometimes I’ve dreamed about work but it was just voices and lines of code (as if someone was sharing their screen on a call with the webcam off).

I wonder if that’s a common theme.

On Saturday my partner and I baked a baguette from [Steph Ango's recipe](https://stephango.com/baguette). I don't personally use Obsidian, but every time I see it mentioned I think about the baguette. It is a really nice recipe.

Vampire Weekend have announced a new album and I'm very excited about it. It was my favourite band when I was a teenager and I still really like them.

I keep thinking about [My darling Ill never let you go.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:My_darling_Ill_never_let_you_go.jpg).

Someone has sadly changed the title now, making the tone a little different, but still somewhat poetic.

Computers were managable this week. I learned about [ANSI colours in console output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors). I wanted to swap a text string in a log message but it was in colour, so I couldn’t easily compare it to the text that I was trying to replace. I stripped the colours first, replaced the string, and then coloured it again so that it didn’t look out of place. But now that I am writing this I can think of a better approach, so I'm going to try that on Monday.

I have started rewriting my [Share Liked Songs](https://nonnullish.github.io/share-liked-songs/) app. I have been getting messages from people wanting to build on top of it and add new features but the libraries are outdated and it barely builds now. Plus the code is really bad. I know how I can make it better now so I'm glad I'm making progress.

I also finally managed to login into my Firefox developer account and update my extension. It took me three weeks but it seems to be working now. Apparently all my devices had a time shift so significant that [the time-based one-time password algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) was failing. All of them had the time set automatically, but somehow when my work computer showed 12:00, my phone would show 12:01, and my personal computer - 12:02. I felt like [Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll](/weeknotes/attachments/russian_doll.webp). I set the time manually according to what my phone was showing and it seems to have fixed the issue.
