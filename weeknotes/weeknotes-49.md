On Friday the sunniest place in Poland got only 6 minutes of sunlight. I like how [the map with the cloud cover](https://cmm.imgw.pl/cmm/?page_id=37586) shows how the whole country is basically just 100% clouds. 

I have been trying to make a frame for my plotter. I made a mistake when cutting the pieces and ran out of wood, and so the drawing area got really small. I made an elaborate simulation that shows if the area is okay. It could be worse and the resolution shouldn't be too bad. I wish there was a makerspace in my city. There used to be one, but it got closed because of the pandemic, and it didn't reopen. I remember I considered going to a welding course there, but eventually never went.

My partner has bought a new domain for our home server. I think I want to self-host more things. I made a scraper that showed all listings from cinemas in our city and we've actually used that a bit. I like the idea of having programs like that. I've been making a page where we would put gifts that we'd like to get. A bit too late for Christmas but it still should be useful. I am just using HTML and figuring out how things are supposed to work without overblown JavaScript frameworks. One neat thing I found today is that [browsers won't redirect to the response after form submission if the code of the response is 204 No Content](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3283126), there's no need for `event.preventDefault()` or anything weird like that.
