I spent some time this week playing with the toothbrush head [again](/posts/resetting-the-timer-in-my-toothbrush/). I took the chip out of an old one and there is some free space on it so I wanted to add extra records. I imagined I would give someone a greeting card with the chip glued in and they would scan it and it would redirect them to philips.com and they’d be like “huh?” and I would say “you have to use an app called NFC Tools and look for the second record” (the first record is the default one and it cannot be cleared). But I must have made a mistake because it’s not writable anymore. I know it locks after three wrong password attempts so maybe I had a typo in my commands. I’ll try again when I replace the toothbrush head the next time.

I was out of town for the weekend to visit friends and it was a lot of fun. We went to a board game event and ended up photographed for the local news website. We played Everdell which is a very picturesque game.

Here's a photo of a weird tree I saw there:
