I haven’t been coding much for a while now, outside of work. I feel like the things that I want to make are far out of scope of my skills, and the things that I am able to do aren’t that interesting to me anymore. There’s probably some term for this. But I am having a good time; I am enjoying my tasks at work, and in my free time I’m just doing other stuff.

I’ve been playing around with fonts and made some changes on this site. I've learnt about [uniwidth fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniwidth_typeface) and now I wonder why all fonts aren't like that. They make layout design so much nicer. I've also watched [a tutorial on making variable fonts with open source tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQuWARCUWI). I knew I recognised the profile picture of the video author from somewhere and it's actually the same person who's made the [TT2020](https://copypaste.wtf/TT2020/) font, which I really like a lot. I wanted to edit it in Font Forge (to clean up rough edges, add variants, split it into unicode ranges) but it takes so much effort. In the end I just cleaned it up a little bit and generated a copy with a limited set of characters. I set that as the font for code blocks on this site. 

As a birthday gift for myself, I bought a second-hand Canon DSLR with a Tamron telelens. I got tired of iPhone's [oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/14odup0/why_does_my_iphone_13_pro_put_an_ugly_oil/) [painting](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13uhv9m/camera_oilpainting_effect/) [effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/xe32wm/seems_like_the_oil_painting_effect_is_still/) and the [new AI features](https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/06/12/remove-objects-in-photos-with-clean-up-in-ios-18). [I want to take a real photo of the Moon](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23637401/samsung-fake-moon-photos-ai-galaxy-s21-s23-ultra), as I see it. The camera is in a good shape, but I probably need to have it serviced because the sensor is a bit dirty and the telelens connector doesn't always work. That really worried me at first, because I kept getting an error with each photo I took, but the seller compensated the servicing costs and I learned what settings do not trigger the error.

I am completely new to photography but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I'm really enjoying the control I have over the settings, too. In some ways I find it easier to use than an iPhone because I know what I have to do to get the result I want, instead of relying on iPhone's random automagic. The day I got it I took around 200 photos of my partner making soup.

I really feel like I'm [channelling David Beckham's son](https://x.com/alicevjones/status/878254329689276416) sharing these photos but I still can't get over the zoom and the depth of field. So, yeah, I'm really happy with my camera. I need to get a proper bag for it so that I can take it outside more confidently.
