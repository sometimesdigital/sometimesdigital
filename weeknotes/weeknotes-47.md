Not much has happened this week. The temperature has been sub-zero and there’s snow on some mornings.

I think I figured out the maths for my plotter, more or less. I read an article that said that “it’s simply just Pythagoras”. It’s a bit more I would say, especially when you add the real world aspect to it, with physical objects and all their mechanical properties. I’m quite optimistic that I can finish this project, which I wasn’t sure about some time ago. But I’m not rushing with it.
