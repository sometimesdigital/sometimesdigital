I keep feeling like I got the date wrong and there are still some days in the year, but I’ve checked the calendar multiple times and it seems the year is in fact ending, so happy new year!

This past year:
  - I completed my engineering degree. 
  - I started working full-time.
  - I had a health scare (but I’m okay now).
  - I became a regular at a local Vietnamese restaurant.
  - I met the kindest people online. 

I think I should have paid more thought to the naming of these notes. Maybe I will change the titles, and make this one “52/23” and the next one “01/24”. I think that could still be confusing.
