This is the year of FIXING THINGS. Last year I started working full-time and I think I have learnt a lot in code review. Having another pair of eyes looking at my code has helped me learn new approaches and ways of thinking; <s>and see more reasons why my code sucks</s>.

Most of the things I put online have been tools, and their objectives had little to do with the underlying code quality. So I feel very conflicted about them, because while they technically work, and sometimes people even use them, they feel wrong, to me.

The productive way out is to at least try to make them better (and accept imperfections) instead of cringing in shame, so I guess that's what I'm going to try to do.

For the past month I have been redesigning a website for a brand making handmade accessories. Three years ago I made a simple static one for them, just for showcasing the products, and now I've added some features that should help them run their sales. I'm happy with what it looks like now. I hope that feeling won't go away too soon.
