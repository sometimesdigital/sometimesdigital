I’ve seen some people on Mastodon posting weekly notes. [I guess it’s good to air your thoughts sometimes.](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/) I like the notes in which people say they didn’t do much. I also like that I can start indexing these from 45. I am going to set the date of this note as yesterday.

I had the Friday off because of a labour law that says that if a public holiday falls on a Saturday then you get a day off. It doesn’t work with Sundays, and it doesn’t work if you’re employed as a contractor. I thought I’d spend that Friday doing some things that I had kept putting off and then go to a stationery shop as a reward. 

One thing was a phone call. Two weeks ago I got a letter from my ISP which said that they’re ending the support for copper infrastructure, and that I have to choose a new plan if I want to have the Internet in December. I didn’t really want to do that because it means that a technician will have to come and drill through the walls of my rented apartment to install the fibre-optic cable. But I chose a plan and scheduled the installation for this week. 

I also got the flu shot at a local pharmacy, which is something you couldn’t do before covid. 

I didn’t buy anything at the stationery shop, but everything was really pretty.

I’ve been thinking about RSS. [Did you know you can style an RSS feed?](https://andrewstiefel.com/style-atom-xsl/) [Did you know you can format text and dates in an RSS feed?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/xslt-2nd-edition/9780596527211/ch04s05.html) [Did you know you can have pagination in an RSS feed?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301392/pagination-in-feeds-like-atom-and-rss) These are technically lies. But they’re true about Atom feeds, which are sort of like RSS. I have always seen feeds as an addendum to a blog, but I wonder if there is a reason why a feed couldn’t be a thing on its own.

I have two small projects that I’m working on. I feel like if I say anything about them then they won’t work out. Is that magical thinking? Or a more real fear that if I get any premature validation on my ideas then I’ll already feel satisfied and unmotivated to continue work? The first one is really cursed. I’m putting it off because [import type assertions are currently broken in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#browser_compatibility) and I kind of need them there. The second one features some electronics. I want to make it pretty, which is actually more problematic than I initially thought.

I made an account on [Puzzmo](https://launch.puzzmo.com) this week. To make an account you have to solve a puzzle. I was really pleased with myself.

Today when I opened my work computer I realised that there was an empty space in the icons where VS Code used to be. It literally disappeared and I had to install it again. Technically this is out of the time range for this week note but I hope that’s okay.
