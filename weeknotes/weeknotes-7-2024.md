I've played around with this website a little bit this week. I got a bit obsessive about the font choice to the point that every font feels wrong.

I've made a [page with bookmarks and a blogroll](/links). Currently the blogroll fetches new posts at the build time, so I might either schedule the rebuilds periodically, or set up an endpoint in Cloudflare that would fetch this collection of feeds. I haven't put the hyperlink to it anywhere on the page yet because I don't know where to put it.

The documentation and the options in the free plan in Cloudflare are pretty cool, although I feel like I am once again putting all my eggs into one corporation's basket. I should just put the Raspberry Pi out on the Internet, but it feels like the stakes are pretty high in regards to the security and things like that.

I've bought a Hario V60-02 drip, and now I'm using that for coffee instead of a Bobble Presse french press. They're both really good, but the drip is easier to clean.

I have read [a great article about SimCity and The Sims](https://donhopkins.medium.com/designing-user-interfaces-to-simulation-games-bd7a9d81e62d). I was born too early for The Sims, but just in time for The Sims 2, which still had a lot of good parts of the first game. It is quite important to me.
