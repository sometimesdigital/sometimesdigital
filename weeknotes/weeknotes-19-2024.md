I've added some things to this page, like the [search](/search/) function. I was surprised to see that [a project](https://nonnullish.github.io/around-the-world/) that I haven't touched for three years still works (with an old version of React! and two external apis!!!). I might update the dependencies and improve some things when I have time because I do really like that idea.

I have received a new work computer and [don't have to decide between Chrome and Docker Desktop anymore](/weeknotes/weeknotes-17-2024/).

Yesterday my partner and I watched Eurovision. In my opinion, a good Eurovision song should: *1.* be catchy, *2.* be funny *3.* be somewhat political, *4.* have lyrics in the language of the country that it's representing, and *5.* not have corny rap interludes. I really liked Croatia's song, which met most of these requirements. I also really liked the crochet balaclavas.

Today we went on a walk and [saw a cool bird](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/112428755485110882). I haven't seen that bird before and used the [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) app to identify it. The photo recognition didn't work, but the questionnaire did and it turned out to be a *fieldfare*. Cornell also has another bird app, [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), that is sort of like Pok√©mon Go except you collect sightings of real birds.
