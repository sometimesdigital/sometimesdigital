I went to the zoo today and saw a [bongo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongo_(antelope)). 

I saw The Holdovers on Wednesday. It was really nice.

I read [the Wikipedia page about email addresses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address) this week. I knew about the impossibility of email validation or the plus-addressing, but I didn’t know that some servers (gmail) choose to ignore dots in the email address, so that e-mails addressed to `jane.doe@gmail.com` will go to `janedoe@gmail.com`. It’s crazy that something so important is so arbitrary and the server provider can decide on it.
