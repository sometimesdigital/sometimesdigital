Happy Sunday! (Barely). The past week wasn't very eventful computer-wise. At work, for the first half of the week I was fighting Kubernetes and for the second part I was working on a decorative component (as a sort of therapeutic measure I guess). I lost the fight with Kubernetes. I kept getting “out of memory” errors. That's why next week I’m getting a new work computer. The memory has been an issue for some time now but I didn't really notice. It was fine when I could fix it by closing Google Chrome but now that wasn’t enough anymore. I’ve been working on the same laptop since my internship so I guess it is time for an upgrade.

Today I got a new domain and set up e-mail. Please send me an e-mail. It's nonnullish[at]sometimes.digital. 

*Sometimes digital -- but mostly analog.*

To set up the domain on this site I have to move from Cloudflare Pages because [Cloudflare doesn't allow outside DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-cname-record) and I don't want to be locked-in into the Cloudflare tooling. I think I'm going to move some of my repositories to Codeberg & maybe leave the RSS feed here with redirects to the new domain. But it's sort of late now so that's for later.
