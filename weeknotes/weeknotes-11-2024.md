[I’ve started writing down all my computer-related dreams](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/112072873619967073). I’ve had many throughout the years. Sometimes in my dreams I’m doing pair programming. It would be funny to believe that the other person is also having that dream. Sometimes I’m debugging something, and it’s usually something related to an actual issue I’ve had.

[Prompted by Tomoe](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nondescryptid@kopiti.am/112081524388154036), I read up on Freud’s dream analysis on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irma%27s_injection). There was this fragment:
 
> Freud concluded that the motive of his dream was a wish and the content of the dream was a wish fulfillment. Freud eventually concluded that all dreams represent some sort of wish fulfillment.

I like the phrasing and the subtle note of mockery for Freud’s overzealous generalisation. But that’s quite accurate here. 

My computer dreams are always nice. “Maybe computers are like a safe space for you”. The next night after my Docker dream I had a pretty gory nightmare that had nothing to do with computers.

I’ve been repairing a woollen sweater with Swiss darning. The idea is to reinforce the existing structural integrity of the fabric, rather than making a new layer. If you’re really careful about it, the stitching can be invisible. But I’m not, and I’m using red yarn, and making the patches heart-shaped.

I've been writing a little tool for making wall calendars. [I wrote about that some weeks ago](/weeknotes/weeknotes-1-2024/), but it's taking me a while. I wanted to rewrite it in Preact this time, but I'm feeling very stupid and can't make it work the way I would like it to. Maybe I'll get it done before the next year.
