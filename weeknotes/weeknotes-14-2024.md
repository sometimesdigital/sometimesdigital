I went biking today and sort of passed out afterwards. It was quite unexpected and scary. I’d never passed out before and I thought I was dying but I didn’t so that’s good.

I’ve been working on a home-cooked app with my partner and I’m really happy with how it works. It’s running on our Raspberry Pi and we have it installed as PWAs on our phones (hence [my note about a neat CSS trick](https://sometimes.digital/posts/disable-scroll-bounce-in-pwas/) from earlier this week). I might write about the app more at some point.

I wrote [a note about weeknotes](https://sometimes.digital/posts/about-weeknotes/) at the beginning of the week. I’ll put the link on the index page as an introduction of some kind.

We’re starting something new at work and I’m learning new patterns and approaches. I’m using some of this in the rewrite of [my Spotify tool](https://nonnullish.github.io/share-liked-songs/). It’s taking me forever but it really should be up soon.

“not actively maintained” software <br/>
was genuinely a good thing <br/>
that just meant the software was finished <br/>
had no bugs <br/>
and needed no new features or fixes <br/>

I haven’t pushed any changes in years but that’s because it’s been working (most of the time). But I’m getting comments that it looks abandoned so I do want to sweep the dust off a little bit.
