This week I’ve been writing some code for the household Raspberry Pi. We have it set up with a domain, a git server, and some pages. One shows screenings at the local cinemas. There is a website that lists all screenings at the cinemas in the city, but it doesn’t really show much information about the films, only the titles. So I’ve made a scrapper that combines the screening schedules with information from TMDB. On Monday I saw “Dream Scenario”. Although I didn’t have the scrapper finished at that point.

There’s also a page for generating a printable wall calendar. I had fun using millimetres as units in CSS. There are probably a lot of better approaches for this, but it’s just for me and my partner so it doesn’t have to be perfect. And I wanted it to be localised, with holidays and [name days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_days_in_Poland). I don’t think name days are celebrated in other countries in the same way, and I like the idea, so I wanted to have them in the calendar.

I had fun setting the typography for the calendar too. There are some pretty fonts out there. I helped Katherine choose a font for [her website](https://kayserifserif.place/) and it looks really nice. I mean, I just recommended a font that was a different version of the font that she had already been using, but still. Lifestyle in progress: font person.

I’ve been watching “The Curse” and I’m really enjoying it.

I spent some time this week crocheting a cover for my old headphones. The polyurethane has been peeling off and I thought I could replace those parts with yarn. I wanted to make them look sort of like the forest floor, with tree roots, and mushrooms, and stones. [I like how they turned out](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/111703637933604399), even though they’re a bit messy. 

I don’t really have the patience for crocheting. I don’t understand why it’s such a big trend among teenagers right now because it’s extremely laborious. It makes my wrists hurt, it gives me eye strain, and it makes me ruminate and clench my jaw for some reason.

Although the tension in my jaw may be caused by my wisdom teeth coming in, rather than the crocheting. Wikipedia says that *the eruption* typically occurs before the age of 25, and I am turning 25 this year, so, yeah, seems like the right time. I didn’t really plan for this but maybe that is going to be the theme for this year.
