Not much has happened this week.

Yesterday I made an error in a hard-coded nested list of constants and asked ChatGPT to decrease each number by one. It made so many mistakes. It took me less time to just write a function to transform that data. I felt bad for trying to take a shortcut.

I also got locked out of my Firefox account because of botched two factor authentication. I think the clocks in my computer and my phone may be a little out of sync and by the time the code shows up, it's already out of date. Or maybe it's something else, because now that I wrote it down it sounds a bit dumb. But other people have that issue too, and they recommend a browser extension that pretends to be the second factor. It worked at first, but then still showed an error later. So I can't update my extension and have to bear the shame of disappointing the twenty three people who have installed it.
