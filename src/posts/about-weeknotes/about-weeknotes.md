[Here's a nice post about weeknotes that I find quite valuable](https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes).

> Individuals have fully rounded interests: yes this person is reporting on projects, but they’re also alive with feelings, and oh by the way they’ve also gone out and got ice creams for the office because it was hot this week.

My approach is that:

 - I write the notes for myself, mostly. I’d like them to be *nice*, but I’d also like to be free of any expectations or pressure.
 - I want them to be generally computer-adjacent, at least in part.
 - I would like them to be inviting — I’d like people to feel welcome to reach out to talk about things I’ve mentioned, or anything else.

Weeknotes are just personal blog posts that I write once per week. But I like the concept, the indexing (I just write the week number - that way I don’t need to quantify the notes, and it gives a general idea of the time in the year), and how at the end of the week I see notes from people I like. I have [a separate RSS feed for weeknotes](/feeds/weeknotes.xml), but they do also go [into the general one](/feed.xml). Sometimes I post the links on Mastodon, but I usually don’t.

The weekly schedule means that I can dedicate some time specifically for this. I don’t like to think too much about blogging or microblogging. I don’t like the compulsive urge to turn things into blog posts, or the workshopping of the phrasing of a tweet in the back of my head. Setting up a time in the week to write some thoughts works well enough. Sometimes I write things down for later during the week, but it’s not that intrusive.

I write my weeknotes on Sunday evenings my local time. At first, I wrote them on Mondays, but I felt like I had parts of the new week leaching into the past week. I retroactively changed the dates for consistency. *I have a permit: I can do what I want*. I haven’t skipped a week yet, but that would be okay too.

I try not to paint the grass green in my notes. I don’t mind writing that I’m working on a one day project for three weeks in a row, and sometimes (often) I stop giving updates on an abandoned idea. Some weeks I take a walk more interesting than anything I did on the computer, so I may write about that, or sometimes I don’t have anything to write about at all, and the note will say so.

I do also keep in mind who might read the notes. I’m not very consistent about what I find too personal to put online, and I try not to restrict myself too much, but still. In a way that makes me feel more harmonious in how I present myself to strangers, coworkers, and close ones.

So this is what works for me. I might update this post if I think of something more to say.
