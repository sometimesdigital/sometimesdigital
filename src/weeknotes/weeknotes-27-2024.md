Yesterday I went for a very long walk and found a blue jay feather.

Earlier in the weekend I also added a requested feature to [my silly browser extension](/projects/fast-fashion-begone/).

I’ve been tidying the apartment and found some forgotten trinkets. This includes my dad’s old digital diary. Every couple of years I find it again, see if it works (it still does), and put it away, but maybe it would be fun to actually learn what it can do. And maybe I’ll even try to connect it to my computer. For that I would need a very particular cable. I remember a lecture in which my professor stressed the importance of proper voltage in serial communication. I don’t want to fry the device so I’m not sure if I’ll actually do it but I might look it up. It would be really fun to make it work, especially since the software was written for Windows 3.1.
