I’m still sick, and at this point I’m considering going to the doctor but also I don’t really want to.

At work, I’m between projects so I have some time for learning new things.

I bought a second-hand solar charger online for around €3. The seller sent it in a red envelope that said “infectious waste” and had a biohazard symbol. I was testing it a bit and [put together a web server on an ESP32 microcontroller](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/113136959490155095). I’m going to write down my notes about it all at some point.
