Computers have been *sooooo* annoying this week… The vibes are off. I’ve had Bluetooth issues with almost all of my devices. I used to be very happy with my Bluetooth mouse, my Bluetooth keyboard, and my Bluetooth headphones. *Everything used to work so smoothly.* I never had to remember to connect anything; when I turned my computer on everything magically connected and when I turned it off they’d all go to sleep mode. But on my new work computer the headphones now get disconnected randomly. I get a very helpful notification “your headphones aren’t working” and I have to leave the meeting, disconnect them, and then connect them again. Sometimes only one of them gets disconnected, as if that made it any better.

And something is weird with my mouse too. I tested a new mouse and later the one I normally use started lagging and just moving weirdly. Although I think it got back to normal now.

The new mouse was a broken gaming mouse that I bought really cheap. I mostly bought it because of the description:

> **PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**

> *Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed mouse*

> In 2022, the left switch began to double click. I reported it to Razer and they suggested a new driver. I installed the driver and it helped for some time (apparently this driver had a smaller debounce for the signals). After the warranty expired, the problem started occurring again.

> I decided to fix it. I bought microswitches (that was August 2022), unscrewed the mouse and it turned out that... my soldering iron did not heat up. I got angry, bought a Logitech MX Master 3 and since then the Razer mouse has been sitting in the drawer. I'm tidying my flat and I decided that I don't want to repair it anymore.

> I marked it as damaged so that there wouldn’t be any surprises later.

> I tested it yesterday (May 13, 2024) and everything works, except that the left click sometimes still gets lost. If someone has a soldering iron and some time, they will have a nice and cheap mouse.


Love a good story! And boring ones too. I do have a soldering iron and also too much time. And [I repaired a mouse like that once already](/posts/replacing-switches-in-logitech-g603/) so I thought it would be a fun activity. Sort of like building those miniature dioramas.

But it was really annoying to desolder the broken switch. The lead free solder is more difficult to work with and for some time I wondered if my iron was also broken because I couldn’t get it to melt the solder. But I did fix it eventually and it is pretty nice. I thought I would sell it, but I might actually keep it. My weapon accuracy in Overwatch is now around 10% instead of the 8% that it was before.

Here's a cursed snake I've made:

[Here's the link](/pages/snake/). It's more of a proof of concept.
