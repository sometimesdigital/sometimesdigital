For the last two weeks I was on holidays. I added some photos to my [photo stream](/photos). The first couple of days I spent in Northern Poland, and then I took a ship to Sweden.

In Poland, I stayed in Międzyzdroje. Międzyzdroje is near Świnoujście, which borders with Germany. There is a wonderful route for pedestrians and cyclists between Świnoujście and Ahlbeck. Because of the Schengen Area, there is no passport control on either side of the border.

The ship to Sweden was really fun. I saw the Baltic 2 offshore wind farm. We arrived to Ystad in the evening and spent the next day walking around the town. I wanted to take a photo of each house there because of how colourful and beautiful they were.

The next stop was Malmö, where I got by a train. There are wonderful parks such as the Kungsparken and the Pildammsparken, and a beautiful beach. I went to the Malmö Museum, which has a huge variety of exhibits (and an aquarium!), and the Technology and Maritime Museum, [where you can enter a submarine](https://malmo.se/Uppleva-och-gora/Konst-och-museer/Malmo-museum/Utstallningar/Aktuella-utstallningar/Fordon-och-farkoster/Ubaten-U3.html).

Malmö and Copenhagen are connected by the [Øresund Bridge](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oresund-bridge), which is really half-bridge, half-tunnel. I spent a couple of days in Copenhagen, where I saw the Glyptotek, the Citadel (Kastellet), St. Alban's Church, Frederik's Church, the Assistens Cemetery, the Freetown Christiania, and the Botanical Garden. I really love glasshouses that look like castles. The tickets to the Glyptotek are free on each last Wednesday of the month, which was a nice coincidence, because I didn't plan for that beforehand.

I got sick on the day I was getting back home. But I'm glad that my immune system waited for my holidays to end, even though it does mean that I will be going back to work with a stuffy nose.
