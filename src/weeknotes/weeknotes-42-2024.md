I didn't write weeknotes last Sunday. The two main things that happened in this time were that I went to a ceramics class, where I sculpted two slightly impractical bowls, and also that I finished watching a show called “We Are Lady Parts”, which was really funny and nuanced. I also ordered some interesting electronic parts from AliExpress, which I'll use to update my solar powered web server. I should have called it barely.ever.digital instead of only.sometimes.digital, but that domain currently costs $15 000.
