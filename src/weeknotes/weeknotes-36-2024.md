I think I may have covid, or something of the kind. I've been sick the whole week. Also, I've got some bad news at work. It's just work but it's sad to part ways with coworkers that I liked working with.

As a sort of therapeutic measure, I've been making some very silly computer programs. The moodboard: [samperson's projects](https://samperson.itch.io/), [transparent textures dot com](https://www.transparenttextures.com/), [Winamp skins](https://skins.webamp.org/), the hellscape that is modern web development, [the ruler tool from Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/screen-ruler). [Here's an example](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/113091758799837014).

I've watched a film called [Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person](https://letterboxd.com/film/humanist-vampire-seeking-consenting-suicidal-person/). I liked it.
