Today was Easter, and also central Europe switched to the summer time. It was a stressful week (although not necessarily for those two reasons). I'm looking forward to having more peace of mind in the next one. I woke up around 1:55 at night and then saw my phone switch from 1:59 to 3:00.

There was a child on the train who was talking about how one plus one should equal eleven and four plus six should equal forty-six. One day he'll discover JavaScript and be [delighted](https://wtfjs.com/wtfs/2010-02-19-concat-coerce).

I noticed that my grandma's dog has a QR tag on her collar. It points to a website that's supposed to query a database with the dog ID in the params. Something was wrong with the captcha and it didn't work, and then when the query finally went through, it said that there is no such ID in the database. If the dog got lost there would be no way to contact my grandma directly, which seems really dumb.

We were talking about Markdown with my partner and he said that it annoys him how the less important the heading, the more hashes it gets. I didn't think about it this way before but it really was a "whoa" moment.
