This week I finally updated [my Spotify tool](https://nonnullish.github.io/share-liked-songs/). I think I'm happy with how it works, but I haven't gotten any feedback yet from the people who actually use it.

Not much to say otherwise. I'be been feeling sort of low and inadequate.

My peace lily is blooming and the flowers look really freaky.
