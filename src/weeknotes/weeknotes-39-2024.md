My solar-powered web server is almost done, but the battery is at around 45% and if I put it online now, it won't survive the night. On a full charge it should last around 6.5 hours at maximum current consumption and around 25 hours at stand-by, so it will definitely go offline a lot considering the amount of sun we get. That is part of the charm.

I went mushroom hunting today but didn't find a single edible mushroom. The closest one was [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylopilus_felleus). It is literally called "satan" here. [The "Edibility" section of that Wikipedia article is particularly funny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylopilus_felleus#Edibility).
