On Monday, I published my post about my unnamed [solar-powered web server](/posts/solarpunk-web-server). [Thank you to all that made it happen](https://loving.quest/posts/putting-chunked-transfer-encoding-behind-nginx/). The server was online from the afternoon until late night, and then it was offline for the rest of the week. I slightly miscalculated how long the battery would last, but while it was up, I got some really nice messages in the guest book, even one written in Basque. I also got some messages from people who only saw it later, after it went offline, but wanted to participate.

I didn't really realise how little direct sunlight central Europe gets in Autumn and Winter. I think we'll be getting some sun this week though.

I have an idea for a similar project (but less scrappy). I need to plan what parts to order first. Maybe I'll make it in time for the Spring.

I went to a plant market and got some plants. The market is typically organised each Autumn and each Spring. It's sort of funny that all these beautiful, tropical plants are sold in October, but I guess you can buy them again in the Spring if they don't survive the darkness and the cold of the Winter. Tomoe called it "planned obsolescence", which I thought was very funny.
