I've been tinkering with the solar charger that I mentioned [last week](/weeknotes/weeknotes-37-2024/). I've managed to use some parts that I've bought throughout the years and have never used. I basically tore out the PCB and replaced it with a TP4056 charging module. I have read a lot of very conflicting opinions about this charging module online and I am a bit afraid that my Li-Pol battery will randomly explode. But hopefully it will not? I'll write down my notes on this project some time soon but I still want to add some more things.

I spilled coffee on my keyboard and got a bit worried when I saw it flowing out of the USB-C port, but after thorough cleaning and drying it seems to be fine.

I've been rewriting an expense sharing app that I've made with my partner. Currently it's in htmx and it works well but it's a bit annoying to maintain. This time we're doing a REST API and I'm rewriting the front-end in Vue. My only other encounter with Vue was when I [made a pull request to Elk](/weeknotes/weeknotes-9-2024/) so I'm not exactly fluent in it (yet).
