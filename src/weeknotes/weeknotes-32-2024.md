I guess some of my neighbours are in a mariachi band. Today they were rehearsing while I was trying to rewrite git history.

I have notifications on for new listings for broken computer mice. They’re kind of fun to repair (I somewhat relate them to model diorama kits), and often have a pretty high resale value (especially the gaming ones). Last week I saw a listing in which the seller wrote that his younger brother smashed the mouse against the wall because of unidentified connection issues. That caused the plastic to break. I asked him if the electronics were intact, and he wrote that technically everything still worked. From his tone I sort of got that he didn’t want it to go to waste, but didn’t know how he could repair it; he mentioned he tried to glue the plastic but that it wouldn’t hold up. I looked up the broken parts on Aliexpress and they cost around €5, so I told him about it, and he seemed really thankful. He said that he could still sell it to me (he listed it for around €0.25) but I thought that would be a disappointing end of the story.
