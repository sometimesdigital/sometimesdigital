Some time ago, I rewrote a project that I made around four years ago, which I called [Around the World](/around-the-world). I tend to call my projects with names that are a bit corny, but I do think this one works because the app finds music from different countries from all around the world, and then there's also the Daft Punk song.

I think that making something with the Spotify API is a really fun way to learn a bit of web development because the documentation is well written and the endpoints offer a lot of functionalities. And it's a good way to learn concepts such as REST and OAuth. Four years ago I was still sort of starting out so there was a lot of room for improvement in my code. The recommended authorization mode has also changed to [PKCE](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow), so it was cool to learn more about that.

I wanted to redesign the page to make it look *cool*, so I made an animated globe that is supposed to look like a disco ball. I think it meets the objective. A couple of days later I found [this incredible article titled "Making the World From Scratch"](https://elliot.website/a/article_world). But we can't all be God (or... Nara Smith?), so my world will be made from store-bought ingredients (that is, Three.js).
