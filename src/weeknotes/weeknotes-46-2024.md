I fell out of the loop with my weeknotes. The autocorrect in my phone corrected that to “weak notes” which is so appropriate. I started writing them over a year ago and my schedule of summing up my week each Sunday has decayed since then. 

That is mostly because what I’ve been doing doesn’t feel particularly right for writing about here. I’ve been talking with friends more and also going outside which lets me air my thoughts in what feels like a more worthwhile way.

At work, I’ve been working on an internal tool that is based on GrapesJS. I’m really enjoying that because there’s a lot of tinkering involved. Sadly it doesn’t bring business value directly but there is a vague possibility that it will be useful to someone somehow.
