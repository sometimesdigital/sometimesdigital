This week I donated blood. The nurse had one of those new, foldable Motorolas, which I had never seen before (in real life). I thought the blood mixer was a pretty interesting device.

I'm thinking of buying a DVB-T USB stick. I like the awkward antennae and the AliExpress comments in which people complain that the stick doesn't work in South Korea or Mexico, or that it's not good for tracking planes. I need to research the subject first. I know that some people have their Raspberry Pis set up as TV tuners, streaming TV to the network devices. I don't have a TV, but every couple of months there's an event (like the Olympics, or the Eurovision) that would be easier to watch on TV, without first having to find a streaming site.
