Computers were pretty insignificant this week. I’ve had a really weird week at work (good!!! but so weird) and then family have been visiting so I haven’t had much time to tinker during the weekend.

I finally remembered to buy a CR2032 battery so I’m going to play a bit with the Casio digital diary that I mentioned [last week](/weeknotes/weeknotes-27-2024/). I want to do a write-up about it because it is pretty interesting.

Last night [I had a dream that I shared my private SSH key](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish/112783488401164970). In that dream I made it a file name for whatever reason and shared that file with someone, only later realising the horrible mistake. I really like those hyper-specific computer dreams. This week at work I tested file upload and discovered unhandled errors caused by some file names, so I guessed that influenced it.
