[My PR that I mentioned last week](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/pull/2645) got merged! I was really happy. It was really nice to read comments from people who found that bug annoying and were glad that someone (me) fixed it.

I changed the font on this site to the system monospace font. That's how serious I am about computers. I also removed Giscus. I didn’t like that it depended on GitHub. It’s a bit sad that these comments are now detached (still existing in the GitHub discussions but not placed on this blog). They’re still in my heart, which I guess is what matters.

I’m still thinking what form of contact information I should put here instead.

Today I finished a D&D campaign. The GM is becoming a dad so his priorities have kind of shifted. “[The baby that ended a world](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@chipperdoodles@chaos.social/111903128263770133)”. We played online, on Discord, and used [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/), hosted on [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) with the free tier. I thought that setup was pretty neat.
