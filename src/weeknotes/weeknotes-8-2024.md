I have mentioned on my GitHub profile that Mastodon DMs are my preferred method of communication. I do remember writing that there:

```diff-md
- **if you have a question about a post or a project feel free to contact me on twitter [@nonnullish](https://twitter.com/nonnullish)** :)
+ **if you have a question about a post or a project feel free to contact me on mastodon [@nonnullish@indieweb.social](https://elk.zone/indieweb.social/@nonnullish)** :)
```

Since that change I have got a message from a person who mentioned that they had to make a Mastodon account for me specifically, and another one from someone who wondered whether pulling my e-mail from my commit history would be rude and eventually decided against doing that. Both of these messages were very lovely, but they did point my attention to the inconvenience of the medium.

(I was also worried that my private e-mail could be in my commit history, but that was only the case in one private repository from four years ago. I learned about [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) and rewrote the commit history. All the other commits had the [GitHub alias e-mail](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address), but, to be honest, I am not happy about that. Now if I wanted to move to any other git hosting platform, all of my commits will have a no-reply e-mail with my GitHub account ID and username attached. The two things that I wish I had learned when I first started coding would be 1) turn off the CRLF line endings in the git config and VS Code for the love of God and 2) if you don't want to use your real name at least be consistent about it.)

Mastodon DMs sadly aren't interchangeable with Twitter DMs. I would say that the design of the DMs is the worst part of Mastodon, which I otherwise really enjoy. I will probably end up making an e-mail for my internet activity and put that somewhere here, but that still won't replicate the ubiquity and the convenience of Twitter DMs.

I used to think that anything on the internet stays there forever, and now I am struggling to comprehend the impermanence of my choices. It feels like the bad ones can't be changed, and the good ones eventually stop working.

Anyway, some good things that happened this week: I fed some ducks with oats (they seemed happy) and made a vegan omelette with mung beans (the possibilities that come with beans are endless),
