This week, as an early Christmas present, I got tools for making linocut prints. Here's a messy bird:

I don't know if I agree with the loaded language in the Wikipedia entry of this bird: "[the Eurasian bullfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_bullfinch#Description)". I'd call it majestic and perhaps round.

Other than that, I have been [adding card games to an e-book reader](/posts/modding-a-kobo-libra-2/) and [playing with the configuration of this site](/posts/generating-images-eleventy/).

I'm thinking about resolutions for the next year. I had two for this year, and I didn't do any of them. And one of them was actually last year's resolution. I'm also trying to decide whether I want to start logging films, or books, or something like that. I tried to do that in 2022 with films. The first film I saw was The Batman. The second film I saw was The LEGO Batman. Then I didn't watch films for a while, and kind of got bored of logging them, and also thought it would be funny to leave the log like that.
