[This app](https://nonnullish.github.io/share-liked-songs/) lets people copy their liked songs on Spotify onto a public playlist. I don't really use the "Liked Songs" feature on Spotify myself because I mostly listen to full albums and some very particular playlists. But I do like sharing music with others for the purpose of human connection, so I think it’s weird that Spotify doesn’t offer this feature natively; it seems like a good way to share one’s music taste and connect with others. And there is [a Reddit comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/mhqzu5/i_built_an_app_that_lets_you_share_your_liked/) that seems to prove that it’s actually sort of useful (which makes me really happy).
